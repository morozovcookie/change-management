operationId: createCRQ

summary: Create a single change request

description: |
    To create a new change request you should send a POST request to 
    `/api/v1/crq`.

    You should know that change request does not have any unique parameter in 
    request that could be used to prevent creation twice. 
    If you will send two requests with the same body than you will get two 
    change requests with the different unique identifiers.

    As a result you will get relative URL to the created change request in the 
    `Location` header with HTTP status code `201 Created`.
